## 📌 Overview

As a software engineer aiming to broaden my data science skills, I developed a set of scripts in R to analyze and visualize structured data. My goal was to gain hands-on experience with R's syntax and statistical functions, while also producing meaningful visual and numerical insights from real-world datasets.

The software I wrote demonstrates how to import, clean, and analyze data using R. It includes descriptive statistics, visualizations with base R and `ggplot2`, and more advanced techniques such as ANOVA. The primary dataset used was the built-in `iris` dataset, along with external `.csv`, `.xlsx`, and `.txt` files for import demonstrations.

This project helped me understand the strengths of R in statistical modeling, data wrangling, and rapid visualization.

# Development Environment

I developed this software using **RStudio**, which provided an integrated environment for writing and testing R code.

- **Programming Language:** R  and R markdown
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `rio` – for file import/export  
  - `ggplot2` – for data visualization  
  - `psych` – for enhanced descriptive statistics  
  - `stats` – for ANOVA and clustering

# Useful Websites

These resources were valuable in helping me understand R syntax and data handling:

- [R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- [ggplot2 Documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
- [Quick-R](https://www.statmethods.net/)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

# Future Work

Some ideas for future improvements and extensions include:

- Add interactive dashboards using `shiny`
- Include more machine learning methods like decision trees or logistic regression
- Automate data cleaning workflows using `dplyr` and `tidyr`
- Improve visual output with custom themes and annotations
- Use external APIs for real-time data import (e.g., finance or weather data)
